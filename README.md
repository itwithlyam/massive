# Massive

Just your normal NPM package that can do multiple things, including make a string upper or lower case, log information, and even calculate (in the future)!

## Example:

```
const massive = require('@itwithlyam/massive');

const egg = massive.big('egg is egg');

console.log(egg)

// outputs EGG IS EGG

const eggy = massive.small('EGG');

console.log(eggy)

// ouputs egg

massive.write('thing');

// outputs thing
```

Output: **massiveisgreat**

## Installation guide

```npm i --save @itwithlyam/massive```
